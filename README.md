# Food Calorie Predictor Model - README

## Overview

This project implements a food calorie predictor model using TensorFlow and the Food-41 dataset. The model is designed to estimate the calorie content of food images, which can be helpful in applications related to health, diet tracking, and nutrition management.

## Dataset

The **Food-41 dataset** is a collection of 41,000 images across 41 different food categories. Each image is labeled with a specific food category, and the dataset includes the calorie content for each category. This dataset is well-suited for training a deep learning model to recognize various food items and estimate their caloric values.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using **TensorFlow**, leveraging deep learning techniques for image classification and regression. The architecture is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that extracts features from food images and predicts their respective calorie counts.

### Key Components:
- **Convolutional layers**: Extract visual features from the input images.
- **Pooling layers**: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the extracted features.
- **Fully connected layers**: Perform the final classification and regression tasks.
- **Output layer**: Provides the predicted calorie content.

## Training

The model is trained using the images from the Food-41 dataset. The training process includes data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to improve the model's generalization ability. The loss function used is a combination of categorical cross-entropy (for classification) and mean squared error (for calorie regression).

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict the food category and the corresponding calorie content. Common metrics like **accuracy** for classification and **mean absolute error (MAE)** for calorie estimation are used to assess performance.

## Usage

To use the model:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Load the pretrained model or train it using the Food-41 dataset.
3. Provide an input image of food, and the model will predict the calorie content.
